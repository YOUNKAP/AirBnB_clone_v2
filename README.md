## AirBnB clone - MySQL
This project implements the **HBNB - storage abstraction**\
It is  a single useful function, a command line interface from which we can 	`create`, 	`read`, 	`update` and 	`delete` objects in the file storage.

The code uses [pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/2.8.0/).
